*   **Stick to the Schedule:** Follow your schedule as closely as possible, but be flexible enough to adjust as needed.

Time blocking can help you stay focused and ensure that you allocate enough time for all your responsibilities.

## 2. Prioritize Tasks

Prioritizing tasks ensures that you are always working on the most critical activities.

Task management tools can help you organize your tasks, set deadlines, and track your progress. These tools can streamline your workflow and improve your overall productivity.

**How to Minimize Distractions:**

*   **Dedicated Workspace:** Create a quiet and organized workspace where you can focus on your work.
*   **Turn Off Notifications:** Disable notifications on your computer and phone to avoid interruptions.
