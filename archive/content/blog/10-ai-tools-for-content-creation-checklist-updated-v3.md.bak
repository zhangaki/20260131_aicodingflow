This checklist helps you evaluate AI content creation tools to determine which one best suits your needs. For each tool, perform the following checks:

## Jasper

### Step 1: Define Topic and Keywords
- [ ] **Step 1: Define Topic and Keywords:** Choose a specific topic (e.g., "Benefits of AI in Marketing") and identify 3-5 relevant keywords (e.g., "AI marketing", "artificial intelligence marketing", "marketing automation").

### Step 2: Generate Outline
- [ ] **Step 2: Generate Outline:** Use Jasper's "Blog Post Outline" template to generate an outline on the chosen topic, incorporating the keywords. (Pass: Produces a relevant and structured outline with at least 5 headings and at least 3 subheadings per heading, and are the keywords naturally integrated? Fail: Fails to create a coherent outline or omits key aspects of the topic.)

### Step 3: Generate Introduction
- [ ] **Step 3: Generate Introduction:** Use Jasper's "One-Shot Blog Post" template to generate an introduction for the blog post based on the outline. (Pass: The introduction clearly states the topic, engages the reader within the first two sentences, naturally incorporates at least one keyword, and is between 100-150 words. Fail: The introduction is unclear, fails to engage, lacks keyword integration, or is significantly outside the word count.)

### Step 4: Automate Workflow (Zapier Integration)
- [ ] **Step 4: Automate Workflow (Zapier Integration):** Connect Jasper to Zapier and attempt to automate a simple content workflow (e.g., schedule a social media post of the generated introduction).

### Step 5: Verify Automation
- [ ] **Step 5: Verify Automation:** Check if the post was successfully scheduled and published. (Pass: The post was successfully scheduled and published to the correct social media platform at the specified time, with the correct formatting and hashtags. Fail: The automation fails, the post is not scheduled, or is published incorrectly.)

### Step 6: Repurpose Content
- [ ] **Step 6: Repurpose Content:** Use Jasper's "Content Repurposing" template to repurpose the generated introduction into a Twitter thread.

### Step 7: Review Repurposed Content
- [ ] **Step 7: Review Repurposed Content:** Review the repurposed content for clarity, coherence, and platform suitability. (Pass: The tool successfully repurposes the content into a concise and engaging Twitter thread, maintaining the original message and adhering to Twitter's character limits. Fail: The repurposed content is unclear, doesn't adhere to platform limits, or loses the original message.)

## Copy.ai

[Copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai/) excels in automating entire content workflows, not just individual pieces. See our comparison: [Which Wins in 2026? Copy.ai vs Writesonic Breakdown](/blog/copyai-vs-writesonic-2026 "Which Wins in 2026? Copy.ai vs Writesonic Breakdown"). Think of it as a content creation orchestration engine. In our experience, this translates to significant time savings, especially for teams managing multiple content streams.

### Step 2: Generate Ad Copy
- [ ] **Step 2: Generate Ad Copy:** Use Copy.ai's "Ad Copy" template to generate ad copy for the chosen product or service, targeting the defined audience. (Pass: The generated copy is engaging, relevant to the target audience, includes a clear call to action, and adheres to the platform's character limits (e.g., 280 characters for Twitter). Fail: The copy is generic, doesn't resonate with the audience, lacks a clear call to action, or exceeds platform limits.)

### Step 3: Generate Landing Page Content
