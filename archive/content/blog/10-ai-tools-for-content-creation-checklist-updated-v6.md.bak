# AI Content Creation Tool Checklist

This checklist helps you evaluate AI content creation tools to determine which one best suits your needs. For each tool, perform the following checks:

## Jasper

[Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/) is a versatile AI writing assistant that helps you create various types of content. It's like having a brainstorming partner and a skilled writer all in one! See our comparison: [Jasper AI vs Copy.ai 2026: The Data-Backed Truth](/blog/jasper-ai-vs-copyai-2026 "Jasper AI vs Copy.ai 2026: The Data-Backed Truth"). [Read our full Jasper AI review](/blog/jasper-ai-review-2026). Instead of just telling you it's great, let's run Jasper through a practical test. Here's how to see if it fits *your* workflow:

### Step 1: Define Topic and Keywords
- [ ] **Step 1: Define Topic and Keywords:** Choose a specific topic (e.g., "Benefits of AI in Marketing") and identify 3-5 relevant keywords (e.g., "AI marketing", "artificial intelligence marketing", "marketing automation").

### Step 2: Generate Outline
- [ ] **Step 2: Generate Outline:** Use Jasper's "Blog Post Outline" template to generate an outline on the chosen topic, incorporating the keywords. (Pass: Produces a relevant and structured outline with at least 5 headings and at least 3 subheadings per heading, and are the keywords naturally integrated? Fail: Fails to create a coherent outline or omits key aspects of the topic.) **Pro Tip:** Refine the generated outline by adding specific data points or examples you want Jasper to include. This will guide the AI and result in more targeted content.

### Step 3: Generate Introduction
- [ ] **Step 3: Generate Introduction:** Use Jasper's "One-Shot Blog Post" template to generate an introduction for the blog post based on the outline. (Pass: The introduction clearly states the topic, engages the reader within the first two sentences, naturally incorporates at least one keyword, and is between 100-150 words. Fail: The introduction is unclear, fails to engage, lacks keyword integration, or is significantly outside the word count.)

### Step 4: Automate Workflow (Zapier Integration)
- [ ] **Step 4: Automate Workflow (Zapier Integration):** Connect Jasper to Zapier and attempt to automate a simple content workflow (e.g., schedule a social media post of the generated introduction).

### Step 5: Verify Automation
- [ ] **Step 5: Verify Automation:** Check if the post was successfully scheduled and published within 15 minutes of the scheduled time. (Pass: The post was successfully scheduled and published to the correct social media platform at the specified time (± 15 minutes), with the correct formatting (e.g., line breaks, bold text) and relevant hashtags. Fail: The automation fails, the post is not scheduled, or is published incorrectly (outside the ± 15-minute window or with incorrect formatting/hashtags).)

### Step 6: Repurpose Content
- [ ] **Step 6: Repurpose Content:** Use Jasper's "Content Repurposing" template to repurpose the generated introduction into a Twitter thread.

### Step 7: Review Repurposed Content
- [ ] **Step 7: Review Repurposed Content:** Review the repurposed content for clarity, coherence, and platform suitability. (Pass: The tool successfully repurposes the content into a concise and engaging Twitter thread, maintaining the original message and adhering to Twitter's character limits. Fail: The repurposed content is unclear, and doesn't make sense when repurposing, or exceeds Twitter's character limits.)
