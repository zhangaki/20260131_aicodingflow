## AI-Powered Code Review Checklist

Use AI to check for:

*   **Code Smells:** Identify potential design flaws and areas for improvement (e.g., long methods, duplicate code).
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Scan for common security issues (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
*   **Performance Bottlenecks:** Analyze code for potential performance problems (e.g., inefficient algorithms, excessive memory usage).
*   **Code Style Violations:** Enforce consistent code style and formatting.
*   **Test Coverage:** Ensure sufficient test coverage for critical code sections.
*   **Dependencies:** Check for outdated or vulnerable dependencies.

This checklist can be used with tools like:

*   **DeepSource:** (Example tool - needs verification)
*   **SonarQube:** (Example tool - needs verification)
*   **Codacy:** (Example tool - needs verification)
