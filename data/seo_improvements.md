## Rationale

*   **Title:** The original title was too generic. The new title is more specific, highlighting the benefits (boosting content) and the types of tools covered (writing & image generation).
*   **Description:** The original description was also generic. The new description focuses on the benefits (compelling content, stunning visuals, save time) and provides a clear value proposition.
*   **First 120 Words:** The original introduction was a bit slow and didn't immediately address the reader's pain points. The new introduction starts with a question to engage the reader, highlights the benefits of using AI, and provides a clear overview of what the article will cover. It also includes the phrase "writer's block" to target a specific pain point.

## Expected Impact and Follow-up

*   **Expected Impact:** Increase CTR from 1.5% to 2.5% - 3%.
*   **Follow-up Check Window:** 4 weeks
