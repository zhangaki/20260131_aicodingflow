Audit Results: AI Writing Tools Articles

1.  '10-ai-tools-for-writing-blog-posts.md': Needs more specific use cases, a comparison table, and the checklists should be removed. Also, it seems the article is incomplete.
2.  'ai-writing-tools-comparison.md': This article is very short and needs to be significantly expanded with a detailed comparison table and real-world examples.
3.  'ai-writing-tools.md': Needs to be updated with the latest information, the disclaimer should be removed, and more specific instructions should be provided. The link to the comparison guide should be removed or the guide should be filled in.

I recommend prioritizing the rewrite of 'ai-writing-tools.md' to improve its SEO value.
