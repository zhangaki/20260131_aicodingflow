Rewrite Actions for 10-ai-tools-for-content-creation-checklist-updated-v3.md:

* Add more concrete examples: While the checklist is specific, adding more examples of the expected output for each step could be helpful. For example, in Step 2 for Jasper ("Generate Outline"), the article could include an example of a "relevant and structured outline".
* Update links to 2026 versions: Ensure all links to comparison articles are updated to the 2026 versions for accuracy.
* Consider adding a scoring system: To further enhance the utility, consider adding a simple scoring system (e.g., Pass = 1 point, Fail = 0 points) to the checklist. This would allow readers to quantify their results and make a more informed decision.
