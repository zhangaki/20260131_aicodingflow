**Plan:**

1.  **Identify High-Bounce Page:** Create a task to analyze website analytics and identify a page with a high bounce rate (e.g., >70%). The task should include instructions on how to access the analytics dashboard and filter pages by bounce rate.
2.  **Analyze Current Intro:** Create a task to read the content of the identified high-bounce page and analyze its current introduction. The task should include instructions to assess whether the intro clearly states the problem, outcome, and next steps, and whether it uses generic claims.
3.  **Rewrite Intro:** Create a task to rewrite the intro based on the analysis. The task should include instructions to follow the "Done Criteria" provided:
    *   Rewrite intro to show problem + outcome + next step quickly.
    *   Keep style concrete, avoid generic claims.
    *   Confirm headline and intro promise align.
4.  **Implement and Test:** Create a task to implement the rewritten intro on the website. The task should include instructions on how to edit the page content and save the changes.
5.  **Monitor Bounce Rate:** Create a task to monitor the bounce rate of the page after implementing the new intro. The task should include instructions on how to access the analytics dashboard and track the bounce rate over time.
