# Potential Source and Target Pages for Contextual Linking

Based on the website's focus on AI tools, independent developer insights, and automation, here's a list of potential source and target pages:

**Source Pages (Examples):**
*   Comprehensive guide to AI writing tools
*   Best AI tools for productivity
*   How to automate your workflow as an independent developer
*   Tips for choosing the right AI tool
*   Maximizing your SEO via automation.

**Target Pages (Examples):**
*   In-depth review of Jasper.ai
*   Tutorial: Automating social media posting with Buffer and AI
*   Case study: How one developer automated lead generation with AI
*   Comparison of different automation platforms
*   Using AI to generate blog post ideas
*   Beginner's guide to keyword research


I'll use these as a starting point to identify 5 source and 5 target pages for adding contextual links once the website has content. I will make sure target pages have related content.

Next steps:
1.  Once content has been created on the website, review this list, identify appropriate matches, and add at least 10 contextual links.
2.  Ensure the anchor texts are precise and relevant.
3.  Avoid generic anchor texts like 'click here'.
4.  Ensure all target pages exist and the links are working.
