Audit of 5-productivity-hacks-for-independent-developers.md:

Utility: Offers potentially useful productivity hacks, and checklists help make the advice actionable.
Specificity: The descriptions are reasonably specific, but the "Pass/Fail" criteria in the checklists seem overly demanding.
Factuality: The information itself seems factual, but the effectiveness of these hacks can vary.

Rewrite Actions:
1. Simplify the "Pass/Fail" criteria in the checklists. Make them less demanding and more focused on encouraging experimentation.
2. Add a section on tailoring the hacks to individual needs.
3. Include real-world examples of how other developers have used these hacks.
