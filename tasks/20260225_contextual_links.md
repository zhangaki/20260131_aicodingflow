# Contextual Links Implementation

Based on the identified source and target pages, add contextual links with descriptive anchor text to improve crawlability and user experience. Avoid generic anchors and dead targets.

## Source and Target Pages:

*   **Source:** "10 AI Tools for Automating Your Social Media Marketing"
    *   **Target:** "The Ultimate Guide to AI-Powered Content Creation"
*   **Source:** "Boost Your Productivity: Top 5 AI Note-Taking Apps"
    *   **Target:** "How to Use AI for Efficient Task Management"
*   **Source:** "A Beginner's Guide to AI-Powered SEO"
    *   **Target:** "Keyword Research in 2024: Finding Long-Tail Keywords with AI"
*   **Source:** "Monetizing Your Blog: A Guide for Independent Developers"
    *   **Target:** "Building a Successful Online Business: The Indie Hacker's Handbook"
*   **Source:** "The Future of AI in Software Development"
    *   **Target:** "No-Code vs. Low-Code: Which is Right for Your Project?"

## Contextual Link Implementation Plan:

For each source page, find relevant sections where a link to the target page would provide additional information or context for the reader. Use descriptive anchor text that accurately reflects the content of the target page. Ensure the target pages exist and the links are not broken.
