For example, let's say you want to write about "sustainable living." You could enter this seed keyword into an AI keyword research tool like Ahrefs. The tool might suggest related keywords such as:

*   "eco-friendly products" (Search Volume: 5,000/month)
*   "zero waste lifestyle" (Search Volume: 3,000/month)
*   "sustainable fashion brands" (Search Volume: 2,000/month)
*   "reduce carbon footprint" (Search Volume: 4,000/month)

By targeting these keywords in your content, you can attract a more targeted audience and improve your chances of ranking higher in search results.
