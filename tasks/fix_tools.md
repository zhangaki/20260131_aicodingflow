**Title:** Fix broken `search_web` and `visual_audit` tools

**Body:**

The `search_web` and `visual_audit` tools are currently not working, preventing me from completing tasks that require verifying information or assessing visual appeal.

**Steps to fix:**

1.  Investigate the cause of the `search_web` tool failure (No module named 'duckduckgo\_search').
2.  Investigate the cause of the `visual_audit` tool failure (IndentationError).
3.  Implement the necessary fixes to restore the functionality of both tools.
4.  Test the tools to ensure they are working as expected.

**Priority:** 1
