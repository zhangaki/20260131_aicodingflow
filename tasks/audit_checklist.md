**Scores:**

*   **Utility:** 8/10 - Provides a checklist format for evaluating AI tools, which is helpful. However, it's limited to only a few tools.
*   **Specificity:** 7/10 - The checklist provides specific actions for each criterion, which is good. But the criteria themselves could be more granular.
*   **Factuality:** 6/10 - Relies on the user's own experience, which is subjective. It needs more concrete examples and external validation.

**Rewrite Actions:**

*   **Expand the list of AI tools:** Include other popular and emerging AI content creation tools like Writesonic, Scalenut, Simplified, etc.
*   **Add more granular criteria:** Break down the evaluation criteria into smaller, more specific steps. For example, instead of "Ease of Use," consider "UI intuitiveness," "Learning curve," and "Customer Support."
*   **Provide concrete examples:** For each criterion, provide specific examples of how the tool performs. Use screenshots or short videos to illustrate the points.
*   **Include external validation:** Link to reviews, case studies, or comparisons from reputable sources.
*   **Update for 2026:** Ensure all information and links are current for 2026.
