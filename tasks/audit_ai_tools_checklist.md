Audit of 'AI Tools Checklist' article:

*   **Utility:** The article aims to provide a checklist for using AI tools in content creation. It has potential utility but needs improvement. The current version mostly focuses on generating ideas and lacks depth in other areas like writing drafts, SEO optimization, editing, proofreading, and repurposing content.
*   **Specificity:** The article is somewhat specific, providing actions, examples, and pass/fail criteria. However, the level of detail varies across sections. For instance, the "Generate Ideas" section is more detailed than others. The mention of tools like Rytr and Jasper is good, but it could be more specific about their features and how to use them effectively.
*   **Factuality:** The information seems factual, but it's important to verify that the mentioned tools and techniques are still current and accurate. Checking the functionality and pricing of tools like Rytr and Jasper is essential.

**Rewrite Actions:**

1.  **Expand all sections:** The sections on "Writing Drafts," "SEO Optimization," "Editing and Proofreading," and "Repurposing Content" are currently incomplete and need to be fully developed. Provide specific actions, examples, and pass/fail criteria for each.
2.  **Add more tools:** Include a wider range of AI tools relevant to each section. For example, in the "SEO Optimization" section, discuss tools for keyword research, on-page optimization, and link building.
3.  **Update tool information:** Verify the accuracy of information about Rytr, Jasper, Google Trends, and BuzzSumo. Include current pricing, features, and any recent updates.
4.  **Add visuals:** Incorporate screenshots or other visuals to illustrate the use of each tool and technique.
5.  **Reduce excessive internal linking:** The article excessively links to other articles. While internal linking is good, it shouldn't be the primary focus. The links should be contextually relevant and add value to the reader.
6.  **Remove introductory blurb:** The introductory blurb excessively links to other articles and does not add much value. Remove it and integrate valuable content directly into the article.
