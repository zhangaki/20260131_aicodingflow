**Audit of `website-performance.astro`:**

*   **Utility:** Currently, the file only contains a single sentence with a link to another blog post. It doesn't offer any direct utility as a tool.
*   **Specificity:** The content is not specific at all. It's just a general statement with a link.
*   **Factuality:** The link itself might be factual, assuming the target blog post exists. However, the statement itself is too general to assess factuality.

**Rewrite Actions:**

1.  **Develop Actual Tool Functionality:** The file should contain code to create a website performance tool. This could involve integrating with a third-party API or implementing custom performance analysis logic.
2.  **Add UI Elements:** Create UI elements for users to input a website URL and view performance metrics.
3.  **Display Performance Metrics:** Display key performance metrics such as page load time, number of requests, page size, and performance grade.
4.  **Provide Recommendations:** Provide recommendations for improving website performance based on the analysis.
