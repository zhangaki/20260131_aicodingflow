Audit of 'AI Tools Checklist' article:

Evaluation:
* Utility: The checklist format is useful, providing actionable steps for content creators. However, it heavily relies on linking to other articles within the site. While internal linking is good for SEO, it can make this specific article feel less self-contained and less useful on its own.
* Specificity: The actions are fairly specific, providing examples of tools and how to use them. The pass/fail criteria also add to the specificity.
* Factuality: The article mentions specific tools and their features. I need to verify that these features are accurate and up-to-date.

Rewrite Actions:
1. Reduce Reliance on Internal Links: While keeping some internal links, expand on the content within this article to make it more self-sufficient. Provide more detailed explanations and examples within the checklist itself.
2. Verify Tool Information: Use `search_web` to verify the features and descriptions of Rytr, Jasper, Google Trends, and BuzzSumo. Update the article with any changes or new information.
3. Add More Concrete Examples: Expand the examples provided for each action. Make them more detailed and relatable to the target audience.
4. Complete Missing Sections: The sections on "Writing Drafts" and "SEO Optimization" are incomplete. Fill them out with the same level of detail as the "Generate Ideas" section.
5. Anti-AI Cliches: Review the text for any AI-generated cliches, such as "revolutionized the way content creators work." Rephrase these sentences to be more natural and engaging.
