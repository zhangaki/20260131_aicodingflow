<h1>SEO Audit Tool</h1>

<p>
  Getting impressions but low clicks—or clicks that bounce fast—usually means the
  promise isn’t clear in the first screen. The title/H1 don’t match the query,
  the meta description is fuzzy, and the opening lines don’t tell people what to
  do next.
</p>

<p>
  This 3–5 minute audit gives you a concrete fix list: tighten your
  <strong>title</strong> + <strong>meta description</strong>, make
  <strong>H1/H2s</strong> match the search intent, and add 2+ relevant
  <strong>internal links</strong> so readers have an obvious path deeper.
</p>

<p>
  Next step: choose one URL that already has impressions, run the checklist,
  apply the failed items, then re-check your SERP snippet and the updated
  above-the-fold section.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best for:</strong> a quick check before publishing or updating.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Catches:</strong> missing/duplicate titles, vague descriptions, H1/H2
    structure issues, basic internal linking gaps.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Goal:</strong> make the query match obvious above the fold, then keep
    the same promise all the way down the page.
  </li>
</ul>
