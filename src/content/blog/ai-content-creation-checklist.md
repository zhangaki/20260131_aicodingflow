# AI Content Quality Checklist (7 Steps)

AI can help you ship content faster, but speed without QA quietly destroys trust (and rankings). Use this **practical, pass/fail** checklist every time you publish AI-assisted content.

- Run a quick on-page scan with our [SEO Audit](/tools/seo-audit)
- Validate keyword intent using our [Keyword Research Tool](/tools/keyword-research)
- Check technical basics with [Website Performance](/tools/website-performance)
- Pick better tooling with [Best AI Writing Tools: Compared & Reviewed](/blog/best-ai-writing-tools)

---

## How to Use This Checklist

- Print it, paste it into your SOP, or copy into your task manager.
- Each step has **pass/fail criteria**. If you fail a step, fix it before moving on.
- If you’re in a hurry, do steps 1–4 (accuracy + clarity) first, then step 5 (SEO).

---

## Step 1) Confirm the goal + reader intent (PASS/FAIL)

**Action**: Write a one-sentence “job to be done” for the page.

**Pass if**:
- You can state the primary audience (e.g., “B2B SaaS marketers”) in one phrase.
- You can state the desired outcome (e.g., “reduce churn with onboarding emails”) in one sentence.
- The intro promises that same outcome (no bait-and-switch).

**Fail if**:
- The page tries to serve multiple unrelated intents (“buy”, “learn”, “compare”) at once.
- You can’t explain what success looks like after reading.

**Test**:
- Ask someone (or your future self) to read only the title + intro and answer: “Who is this for, and what will I be able to do?” If they can’t answer in 10 seconds → FAIL.

---

## Step 2) Fact-check and source any claims (PASS/FAIL)

**Action**: Highlight every claim that could be wrong (numbers, dates, tool features, legal/medical statements).

**Pass if**:
- Every important factual claim is either:
  - supported by a primary source (docs, official announcement), or
  - rewritten to be non-factual (“often”, “commonly”) without implying certainty.
- Tool features/pricing statements are verified against the vendor’s site.

**Fail if**:
- You publish unverified stats (“X% improvement”) without a source.
- You mention features that don’t exist or are outdated.

**Test**:
- Find and list every number in the draft (percentages, money, dates, counts). If any number lacks a source link or clear “example” label → FAIL.

---

## Step 3) Improve clarity and remove AI “fluff” (PASS/FAIL)

**Action**: Do one editing pass that only removes filler and tightens sentences.

**Pass if**:
- Every paragraph has a single point.
- You can remove 10–20% of words without losing meaning.
- You replaced vague phrases (“game-changing”, “robust”, “revolutionary”) with specifics.

**Fail if**:
- The content repeats itself in different words.
- The copy reads like a generic explainer without concrete guidance.

**Test**:
- Read the first sentence of each paragraph only. If it doesn’t form a coherent outline of the page → FAIL.

---

## Step 4) Add proof: examples, steps, or templates (PASS/FAIL)

**Action**: Add at least one of the following to every major section: example, mini walkthrough, checklist, or template.

**Pass if**:
- A reader can take action immediately (copy/paste or follow steps).
- At least one real-world example is included (even anonymized).
- Any framework introduced (e.g., AIDA, PAS) is demonstrated, not just named.

**Fail if**:
- The page is “concept-only” with no implementation details.

**Test**:
- Pick one section at random and ask: “Could I do this in 15 minutes?” If not → FAIL.

---

## Step 5) On-page SEO: keyword mapping + SERP alignment (PASS/FAIL)

**Action**: Map 1 primary keyword + 3–8 supporting terms, then align headings.

**Pass if**:
- The primary keyword appears naturally in:
  - title (or close variant),
  - H1,
  - first 100 words,
  - one H2.
- Each H2 answers a specific sub-question a searcher would ask.
- You added 2–5 internal links to genuinely related pages.

**Fail if**:
- Headings are abstract (“What you should know”) instead of query-shaped.
- You stuff keywords or repeat the same phrase unnaturally.

**Test**:
- Run the page through our [SEO Audit](/tools/seo-audit) and fix any obvious issues it flags.
- If you’re unsure about the query intent, sanity-check it with our [Keyword Research Tool](/tools/keyword-research).

---

## Step 6) Structure for scanability + conversions (PASS/FAIL)

**Action**: Make the page skimmable and add a next step.

**Pass if**:
- No wall-of-text sections longer than ~6 lines.
- Lists are used where readers compare items.
- You have a clear CTA that matches intent (subscribe, demo, download, tool).

**Fail if**:
- The page is hard to scan on mobile.
- The CTA is generic or unrelated to the article’s promise.

**Test**:
- View the page at a narrow width (phone). If you can’t find the CTA in under 5 seconds → FAIL.

---

## Step 7) Repurpose + publish QA (PASS/FAIL)

**Action**: Create 2–3 derivative assets and do a final pre-publish check.

**Pass if**:
- You produced at least two repurposed outputs (choose two):
  - 1 LinkedIn post
  - 1 short email newsletter
  - 3 tweet-thread bullets
  - 1 30-second script (video/reel)
- Final QA checks all pass:
  - spelling/grammar pass,
  - links open and go to the right page,
  - images have descriptive alt text,
  - the page loads fast enough on mobile.

**Fail if**:
- You publish without checking links, formatting, and load speed.

**Test**:
- Run [Website Performance](/tools/website-performance). If it flags slow load or major layout issues → FAIL until fixed.

---

## Quick “Ship/No-Ship” Gate

Only publish if all are true:
- PASS on Steps 1–5
- No unsupported factual claims remain
- At least 2 internal links added (and relevant)

If you need a shortcut, run [Website Performance](/tools/website-performance) and an [SEO Audit](/tools/seo-audit) before hitting publish.
