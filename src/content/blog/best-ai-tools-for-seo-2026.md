## Our Evaluation Framework

We believe the only honest way to review AI tools is to actually use them. Here is how we structured our evaluation for this 2026 guide:

- **Baseline comparison**: Every tool processed the same set of standardized seo prompts so we could compare apples to apples.
- **Power-user testing**: Beyond basic tasks, we pushed each tool with advanced features, edge cases, and high-volume workloads.
- **Pricing transparency**: We calculated what a real professional user would actually pay per month, factoring in usage patterns and tier limitations.
- **Team feedback**: Multiple team members used each tool independently and submitted blind ratings before we compiled results.
- **Support quality**: We contacted each tool's support team with a technical question and evaluated response time and helpfulness.
