You’re behind on content because every post starts the same way: blank doc, too many ideas, and no clear keyword to lead with.

Use this practical AI checklist to go from “no topic” → “SEO-ready outline” in one focused session:

- Pick 1 keyword + angle you can realistically rank for
- Generate 5+ post ideas that match that keyword
- Draft faster and finish with a publishable structure

Next step: start at **Generate Ideas** and work top‑to‑bottom. No keyword yet? Do 3 minutes of keyword research, choose one long‑tail keyword, then come back.
