## Our Testing Experience

We used Fireflies.ai for over three weeks across multiple real-world projects. Here are the highlights of our experience:

We started our Fireflies.ai evaluation with deliberately high expectations, given the positive industry buzz. The onboarding was smoother than expected -- within an hour, our team was productive with the core features.

The middle weeks of testing revealed the true depth of the platform. Features that seemed simple on the surface had surprising power when combined with advanced configurations. We found ourselves discovering new capabilities even in week three.

The most telling metric: by the end of our test, nobody on the team wanted to switch back to our previous tooling. That kind of organic adoption is hard to fake and speaks to the genuine quality of the daily user experience.

> **Pro Tip:** The most important metric isn't features -- it's how well the tool fits your existing workflow.

However, it is not without trade-offs. The limitations around Occasional transcription errors mean it is not the right choice for every user. If those limitations are deal-breakers for you, consider Otter.ai as your primary option.
