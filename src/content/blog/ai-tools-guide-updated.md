# Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, AI tools can help you ship better work faster: writing clearer drafts, keeping projects moving, and making SEO tasks repeatable. This guide highlights practical categories of AI tools and (most importantly) gives you an execution checklist you can run before publishing.

If you're publishing content on this site, pair this guide with our quick on-page audit tool: [SEO Audit Tool](/tools/seo-audit).

## Publish-Ready Execution Checklist (Pass/Fail)

Run this checklist on *one* page before you hit publish. Every item has a clear pass/fail so you can stop guessing.

1. **Primary keyword is defined (PASS/FAIL)**
   - **PASS:** You can state the exact query in one line (example: `ai tools for writing`).
   - **FAIL:** The page targets multiple unrelated queries or you can’t name the primary query.

2. **Title matches intent and includes the query (PASS/FAIL)**
   - **PASS:** The page `<title>` (or frontmatter `title`) contains the primary query (or a very close variant) and is specific.
   - **FAIL:** Title is generic (e.g., “Ultimate Guide”) without the query/topic.

3. **Meta description is written for a human (PASS/FAIL)**
   - **PASS:** 1–2 sentences that say *who it’s for* + *what outcome they’ll get*.
   - **FAIL:** Missing, duplicated, or keyword-stuffed.

4. **Exactly one H1, aligned to the title (PASS/FAIL)**
   - **PASS:** One `#` heading that matches the page topic.
   - **FAIL:** Multiple H1s or H1 doesn’t describe the page.

5. **At least 4 useful H2s (PASS/FAIL)**
   - **PASS:** H2s map to sub-intents (examples: setup, step-by-step, pricing, best tools, FAQ).
   - **FAIL:** H2s are missing, vague (“More Info”), or repetitive.

6. **Internal links are present and descriptive (PASS/FAIL)**
   - **PASS:** At least 2 internal links with descriptive anchor text (not “click here”).
   - **FAIL:** Zero internal links, or anchors are non-descriptive.

7. **You ran an on-page SEO audit (PASS/FAIL)**
   - **PASS:** You manually checked the 6 items above *or* used our tool: [SEO Audit Tool](/tools/seo-audit).
   - **FAIL:** You didn’t validate metadata, headings, and internal links.

8. **Related tool pages are linked (PASS/FAIL)**
   - **PASS:** This guide links to at least one relevant tool page for next steps.
   - **FAIL:** No clear “what to do next” path.
