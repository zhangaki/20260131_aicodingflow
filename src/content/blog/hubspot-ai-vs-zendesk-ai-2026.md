In our latest technical audit, we put HubSpot AI and Zendesk AI through a series of real-world stress tests. As of early 2026, the industry is pivoting from simple auto-completion to 'Autonomous Agent Mode,' where tools don't just suggest but actually execute across multiple files. This guide compares **HubSpot AI** and **Zendesk AI** based on performance benchmarks, true cost of ownership, and real-world stability.
