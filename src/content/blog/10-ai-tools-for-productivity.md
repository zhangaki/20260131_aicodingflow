## 20-Minute Execution Checklist (Pass/Fail)

Use this when you want results today (not “someday”). Run it once, then repeat weekly.

### A) Pick 1 workflow to automate (5 min)

- [ ] You selected **one** recurring task you do at least 3×/week (examples: meeting notes, email replies, content drafts). **Pass:** you can name it in 1 sentence. **Fail:** you picked “everything”.
- [ ] You wrote a success metric for that task. **Pass:** “Save 30 minutes/week” or “Reply to emails in < 10 minutes/day”. **Fail:** no measurable target.

### B) Implement 1 AI tool (10 min)

- [ ] **Meetings:** you connected a transcriber and created an auto-summary workflow. **Pass:** next meeting generates a summary + action items automatically (Otter.ai / Fireflies.ai). **Fail:** you still copy/paste notes manually.
- [ ] **Writing:** you enabled grammar + tone suggestions in your editor/browser. **Pass:** you used it to rewrite one paragraph today (Grammarly). **Fail:** installed but unused.
- [ ] **Task planning:** you created one calendar block + prioritized list from a prompt. **Pass:** tomorrow has at least 1 protected focus block (Motion / Asana / Trello). **Fail:** tasks exist but no scheduled time.

### C) Verify your content + site basics (5 min)

- [ ] You ran an on-page check on your most important page. **Pass:** you fixed at least 1 issue (missing title/H1, broken link, thin meta description). Use: [SEO Audit Tool](/tools/seo-audit). **Fail:** no changes shipped.
- [ ] You measured performance of a real page URL. **Pass:** results recorded (screenshot or notes) and at least 1 action item chosen. Use: [Website Performance Tools](/tools/website-performance). **Fail:** you’re “going by feel”.

### D) Week 1 outcome (optional but recommended)

- [ ] You saved at least **30 minutes** this week from the automated workflow. **Pass:** time saved logged. **Fail:** no measurable impact.
