- **Agentic reasoning capabilities:** Opus excels at breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps and executing them autonomously. Its reasoning abilities are noticeably superior to other models.
- **Zero-retention data privacy by default:** This is a huge win for organizations handling sensitive data. You can be confident that your data is not being used to train the model or stored indefinitely.
- **Computer Use V2 (90% success rate):** Opus can now reliably interact with a simulated computer environment, enabling it to perform tasks such as browsing the web, running code, and manipulating files.

#### Why You Might Skip It
- **Significantly slower than Sonnet:** Opus is noticeably slower than Sonnet, especially for computationally intensive tasks. This can be a bottleneck if you need rapid iteration or real-time responses.
- **Higher cost:** Opus is only available on the Opus tier, which is more expensive than the standard Claude plan. This can be a significant factor for budget-conscious users.

## Five Key Questions to Consider

1.  **Which model is better for code generation?**

    Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the clear winner for code generation. It's faster, more accurate, and handles a wider range of programming languages. We've found it particularly adept at generating Python, JavaScript, and Go code. While Opus can generate code, it's noticeably slower and sometimes produces less efficient or syntactically correct code. For example, when asked to implement a complex sorting algorithm, Sonnet consistently produced optimized and well-commented code, while Opus often struggled with edge cases and generated verbose code. The Artifacts feature in Sonnet allows you to see the code rendered visually - huge for frontend work.

2.  **How do the reasoning capabilities compare for complex problem-solving?**

    This is where Claude 4.6 Opus shines. Its reasoning capabilities are unmatched. We've tested it on a variety of complex problem-solving tasks, including strategic planning, resource allocation, and risk assessment. Opus consistently outperforms other models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, in these areas. Its ability to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps and execute them autonomously is truly impressive. For example, when given a complex business scenario with multiple constraints and objectives, Opus was able to generate a comprehensive and actionable plan that considered all relevant factors.

3.  **What about data privacy and security?**

    Both Claude and Claude 4.6 Opus offer strong data privacy and security features. However, Opus's default zero-retention policy is a significant advantage for organizations handling sensitive data. This ensures that your data is not being used to train the model or stored indefinitely. While Claude also offers data privacy options, they may require additional configuration or contractual agreements. If data privacy is a top priority, Opus is the clear choice.

4.  **How do the context window sizes impact performance?**

    The 200K context window in Claude is sufficient for most tasks, but the 1M output context in Claude 4.6 Opus opens up new possibilities for complex and lengthy tasks. We've found the extended context window particularly useful for tasks such as summarizing long documents, generating detailed reports, and building autonomous agents that can maintain a consistent understanding of their environment over extended periods. For example, we were able to feed Opus an entire codebase and ask it to identify potential security vulnerabilities, a task that would be impossible with a smaller context window.

5.  **What are the real-world cost implications of choosing one over the other?**

    The cost difference between Claude and Claude 4.6 Opus can be significant, especially for heavy users. Claude's Pro plan is priced at $20/month, while Opus is only available on the Opus tier at $30/user/month. This means that if you have a large team, the cost of using Opus can quickly add up. However, it's important to consider the potential return on investment. If Opus's superior reasoning capabilities and agentic features enable you to automate complex tasks and make better decisions, the higher cost may be justified. We recommend carefully evaluating your specific needs and usage patterns to determine which model offers the best value for your money. Don't forget to factor in the increased compute time for Opus - it's slower and therefore will cost more in terms of tokens used.

## Quick Verdict

*   **Pick Claude if...** you need fast and accurate code generation, are working on front-end development with React, or are budget-conscious.
*   **Pick Claude 4.6 Opus if...** you're building autonomous agents, need unparalleled reasoning capabilities for complex tasks, or require zero-retention data privacy.
