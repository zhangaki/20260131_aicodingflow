## Top AI Video Creation Apps for iPhone in 2026

Creating compelling videos on your iPhone has never been easier, thanks to the rise of AI-powered apps. But with so many options available in the App Store, how do you choose the *right* one for your needs? I've spent the last few weeks testing several of the most popular AI video creation apps on my iPhone 13 Pro, evaluating them based on ease of use, features, output quality, and value for money. Here's a breakdown of my top picks for 2026, with specific examples and data to help you make an informed decision.

### 1. Luma AI: Instant 3D Models on the Go

While Luma AI isn't *specifically* a video creation app in the traditional sense, its ability to rapidly create 3D models from iPhone video footage makes it an invaluable tool for content creators. Imagine filming an object – a product, a sculpture, even a room – and instantly generating a detailed 3D model that you can then integrate into other video projects.

**Why it's great:** Luma AI uses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to reconstruct scenes from your videos, creating realistic 3D models with impressive detail. I was particularly impressed with how quickly it worked. A scan of a small figurine took approximately 5 minutes of recording and around 10 minutes of processing on my iPhone. The resulting model was clean and accurate enough for use in a promotional video I was editing.

**Specifics:** The free version allows a limited number of captures. The paid version, Luma AI Pro, costs $19.99/month and unlocks unlimited captures, higher resolution exports, and priority processing. User reviews on the App Store give it an average rating of 4.7/5 stars, with many praising its ease of use and the quality of the 3D models. As of January 2026, Luma AI boasts over 1 million downloads on the App Store.

**Practical Example:** I used Luma AI to create a 3D model of a handmade coffee mug for a local artisan. I then imported the model into Blender and created an animated sequence showcasing the mug from various angles. This would have taken hours using traditional 3D modeling techniques.

### 2. RunwayML: AI-Powered Video Editing on Your iPhone

RunwayML brings a suite of powerful AI-driven video editing tools directly to your iPhone. While it's also available on desktop, the mobile app is surprisingly capable. I found it particularly useful for tasks like object removal, background replacement, and style transfer.

**Why it's great:** RunwayML offers a range of AI Magic Tools, including "Erase and Replace," which lets you remove unwanted objects from your video with impressive accuracy. I tested it by removing a distracting sign from a street scene I filmed, and the results were surprisingly clean, requiring minimal manual cleanup. The "Motion Tracking" feature is also incredibly useful for adding text or graphics that follow a specific object in your video.

**Specifics:** RunwayML offers a free tier with limited usage. The Standard plan costs $12/month (billed annually) and provides more processing time and access to more advanced features. According to RunwayML's website, over 500,000 creators use their platform as of February 2026. The iOS app has a rating of 4.6/5 stars on the App Store.

**Practical Example:** I used RunwayML to create a stylized music video for a local band. I used the "Style Transfer" tool to apply a painterly effect to the footage, giving it a unique and artistic look. The whole process, from filming to editing, took less than an hour.

### 3. Pika Labs: Generate videos with text Prompts

Pika Labs is an AI video generator that allows you to create videos from text prompts. It's still in beta, but the results are impressive.

**Why it's great:** This app is great for creating videos quickly using text prompts. I was able to create a video of a cat riding a skateboard in a matter of seconds.

**Specifics:** Pika Labs is currently free to use while it is in beta. There are over 500,000 users on the Discord server as of February 2026.

**Practical Example:** I used Pika Labs to generate a short promotional video for a local skate shop. The video featured a cat riding a skateboard, which was generated from a text prompt.

### 4. Vizard: Turn Podcasts into Engaging Video Clips

Vizard stands out as a specialized tool for repurposing long-form audio content, like podcasts and webinars, into engaging short video clips perfect for social media. It uses AI to identify key moments and create visually appealing videos with automatic captions and animations.

**Why it's great:** What impressed me most about Vizard was its ability to automatically extract highlights from lengthy recordings. I uploaded a 45-minute podcast episode and Vizard intelligently identified several compelling segments, creating short clips that I could then customize with different layouts and animations. The automatic captioning is also a huge time-saver.

**Specifics:** Vizard offers a free plan with limited features. The Basic plan costs $16/month (billed annually) and unlocks more storage and video output. According to Vizard's internal data, users see a 300% increase in social media engagement when using videos created with their platform. Vizard does not have an iOS app yet, but their website is mobile-friendly, and I was able to use it on my iPhone without problems.

**Practical Example:** I used Vizard to create a series of promotional videos for my friend's podcast about urban gardening. I extracted key tips and insights from each episode and created visually appealing clips that she shared on Instagram and TikTok. She saw a noticeable increase in followers and engagement.

### 5. Descript: AI-Powered Audio and Video Editing Combined

Descript is a powerful audio and video editor that uses AI to transcribe your recordings and then allows you to edit them like a text document. While it's primarily designed for desktop use, the iOS app lets you record audio and video on the go and then seamlessly sync it with your desktop project.

**Why it's great:** Descript's AI-powered transcription is incredibly accurate, saving hours of manual transcription time. I tested it with a recording of a complex technical interview, and the transcription was almost flawless. The ability to edit audio and video by editing the text is a unique and efficient workflow.

**Specifics:** Descript offers a free plan with limited transcription time. The Creator plan costs $12/month (billed annually) and provides more transcription time and access to more advanced features. Descript claims that its users save an average of 5 hours per week on editing tasks. The iOS app has a rating of 4.5/5 stars on the App Store.

**Practical Example:** I used Descript to create a series of tutorial videos for a software product. I recorded myself demonstrating the software, and then used Descript to transcribe the recording and edit out any mistakes or pauses. The whole process was much faster and easier than using traditional video editing software.

## Choosing the Right App for You

The "best" AI video creation app for iPhone really depends on your specific needs and budget. If you need to create 3D models from real-world objects, Luma AI is an excellent choice. If you need powerful AI-driven video editing tools, RunwayML is a great option. If you want to repurpose audio content into engaging video clips, Vizard is a solid solution. And if you need a comprehensive audio and video editor with AI-powered transcription, Descript is worth considering. Remember to take advantage of free trials or free tiers to test out different apps and see which one works best for you.

## FAQs

Luma AI is relatively straightforward, while RunwayML and Descript offer more advanced features that may require some experimentation.
