Struggling to keep up with the demands of content creation? This AI Content Creation Checklist (2026) gives you a practical, tool-driven workflow—from idea to brief to draft to optimization.

It’s intentionally **tool-agnostic**: use any stack you like, but keep the outcomes the same.

Quick shortcuts:
- Check whether your content is discoverable in AI answers: [AI Visibility & GEO Checker](/tools/aeo-audit)
- Generate long-tail topics you can actually rank for: [Keyword Research Tool](/tools/keyword-research)
- Catch basic on-page + technical blockers before publishing: [SEO Audit Tool](/tools/seo-audit)

## Pre-Writing Phase

*   [ ] Define objectives (1 sentence): What should the reader do or believe after reading? **(Action: Write 3 SMART goals for this piece. Criteria: each goal has a measurable outcome + timeframe.)**
*   [ ] Pick a winnable keyword (not a “big head term”). **(Action: Identify 5 keywords with search volume > 100/month and KD < 20. Criteria: each keyword matches search intent and fits your site’s topical focus.)**
*   [ ] Map search intent: informational vs. commercial vs. navigational. **(Action: Write the primary intent + 2 secondary intents. Criteria: each intent has a matching section outline.)**
*   [ ] Audience snapshot: who is this for, what do they already know, what do they fear? **(Action: Write a 3-bullet persona. Criteria: role, pain point, and desired outcome are explicit.)**
*   [ ] Angle + differentiation: why this page should exist. **(Action: List 3 competing pages and 3 gaps you will fill. Criteria: each gap becomes a section or checklist item.)**

**Helpful tools (examples):**
- Keyword + competitor research: Ahrefs, Semrush, Google Search Console
- Topic discovery: Google Trends, AlsoAsked, AnswerThePublic
- Briefing: Notion, Google Docs, Milanote

## Research & Brief Phase

*   [ ] Build a source pack (links you trust). **(Action: Collect 5–10 primary sources. Criteria: at least 2 first-party docs, studies, or vendor docs.)**
*   [ ] Extract “proof points” you can cite (numbers, definitions, steps). **(Action: Pull 5 facts with URLs. Criteria: each fact has a source + date.)**
*   [ ] Create a one-page content brief. **(Action: Write: target keyword, intent, outline, FAQs, and internal links. Criteria: brief can be handed to another writer and still produce the same article.)**

**AI research assistants (examples):**
- Perplexity (fast web synthesis)
- ChatGPT / Claude (summaries, outlines, rewrites; verify claims)
- Elicit / Consensus (paper discovery for evidence-heavy topics)

## Drafting Phase (Writing)

*   [ ] Generate a first outline, then edit it by hand. **(Action: Create an outline with H2/H3s. Criteria: every section answers a specific sub-question.)**
*   [ ] Draft section-by-section (avoid “one-shot” prompts). **(Action: Write in 400–800 word chunks. Criteria: each chunk includes an example, a step, or a template.)**
*   [ ] Add original utility: checklist, template, table, or mini-framework. **(Action: include at least 1 reusable asset. Criteria: reader can copy/paste it.)**

**AI writing tools (examples):**
- ChatGPT, Claude (drafting + rewrites)
- Grammarly (clarity, tone)
- Hemingway Editor (readability)

## Editing & Quality Phase

*   [ ] Fact-check and remove “AI fluff”. **(Action: Highlight every claim with numbers/timeframes. Criteria: either add a source or rewrite as opinion.)**
*   [ ] Tighten intros + headings (make them scannable). **(Action: shorten each heading to 3–7 words. Criteria: headings read like a table of contents.)**
*   [ ] Add internal links to 3 relevant pages. **(Action: link to 3 pages that naturally extend the reader’s next step. Criteria: no forced linking.)**

## SEO & Publishing Phase

*   [ ] Validate title + meta description (match intent, not clickbait). **(Action: Write 3 variants. Criteria: primary keyword is included naturally; description promises a specific outcome.)**
*   [ ] On-page checklist: one H1, clean H2/H3 hierarchy, descriptive anchors. **(Action: run a quick audit. Criteria: no missing title/description; headings are not skipped.)**
*   [ ] Add FAQ block (2–5 questions) if it improves completeness. **(Action: extract from “People Also Ask”. Criteria: each answer is 2–4 sentences, no filler.)**

## New (2026): AI Discoverability / GEO Checklist

Search isn’t only “10 blue links” anymore—your content can also be surfaced inside AI answers. This section keeps the same structure as classic SEO, but optimizes for retrieval and quoting.

*   [ ] Put the answer early. **(Action: add a 2–3 sentence direct answer under the intro. Criteria: it can be quoted standalone.)**
*   [ ] Use explicit entity language. **(Action: mention the exact tool/product/topic names you want associated. Criteria: no vague “this tool/it”.)**
*   [ ] Add a “How to” block with numbered steps. **(Action: include 5–9 steps. Criteria: each step starts with a verb.)**
*   [ ] Include a small comparison table. **(Action: compare 3–6 options. Criteria: table has at least 2 decision columns like price/use case/limits.)**
*   [ ] Add citations readers can trust. **(Action: link to primary docs. Criteria: at least 2 links to vendor docs or official references.)**
