# Need Social Posts Fast? Use AI to Go From “No Idea” → 7 Ready-to-Post Drafts Tonight

Blank caption again — and you still need posts that send clicks to one specific link.

Outcome: in 30 minutes, you’ll use AI to turn one thing you’re promoting into 7 platform-ready drafts (X/LinkedIn/Instagram) you can publish tonight.

Next step: pick the single page/offer you want traffic to this week. Then run the first prompt to generate 20 angles.

In the next 30 minutes, you’ll use AI to:
- Pick one offer/article to promote (so your posts have a point)
- Generate 20 angles in 5 minutes
- Turn the best 7 into platform-ready drafts (X/LinkedIn/Instagram)
- Create a matching visual from a template (no blank canvas)

## 1) Generate Post Ideas (Angles) With One Prompt

Use AI to brainstorm angles tailored to each platform (short hooks for X, story-led captions for Instagram, and opinion/insight posts for LinkedIn).

Prompt:

> You are my social media strategist. I’m promoting: [WHAT].
> Audience: [WHO].
> Goal: drive clicks to: [LINK/CTA].
> Generate 20 post angles.
> For each angle, give: (1) a 1-line hook, (2) the core point in 1 sentence, (3) a CTA.
> Also label which platform it fits best: X, LinkedIn, or Instagram.

If you want to pick topics people actually search for (so you’re not guessing), use the [Keyword Research Tool](/tools/keyword-research).

## 2) Write Captions That Don’t Sound Like AI

Ask AI for 3 variants per idea (curious, contrarian, and direct). Keep the first line punchy, then add one proof point and a clear CTA.

Mini-prompt:

> Rewrite this post 3 ways: curious, contrarian, direct.
> Keep it under [LENGTH].
> Add one proof point (number, example, or quick story).
> End with a single CTA to click/read.

## 3) Create a Matching Visual (No Blank Canvas)

Most posts die because the first draft looks unfinished. Use a simple template so you’re only swapping text + one image — not designing from scratch.

Workflow:
- Pick 1 template per platform (e.g., quote card, checklist, "3 tips", before/after)
- Paste the hook from your post as the headline
- Add 1 proof point (number, screenshot, or one-sentence result)
- Export in the right size (X, IG, LinkedIn)

Prompt (for an image idea that matches your post):

> Create 5 simple visual concepts for this post.
> Post topic: [WHAT].
> Hook: [HOOK].
> Each concept should specify: layout (headline + supporting line), what image/icon to use, and what data/proof to include.

If you want to audit your page first so your posts send traffic to something that converts, run the [SEO Audit Tool](/tools/seo-audit).

## 4) Turn 20 Angles Into 7 Posts (Pick Winners Fast)

Don’t publish all 20. Pick 7 with clear intent so each post earns its spot.

Quick filter:
- 2 “how-to” posts (teaches one specific thing)
- 2 “mistake” posts (calls out a common wrong move)
- 2 “proof” posts (numbers, screenshots, mini case study)
- 1 “opinion” post (a strong take that attracts the right people)

Then ask AI to draft them in the right format:

> Using the 7 angles I selected below, write 1 post per angle.
> For each post:
> - Platform: [X/LinkedIn/Instagram]
> - Structure: hook → 2–4 short points → proof point → CTA to [LINK]
> - Keep the voice: [direct / casual / analytical]
> - Do not use emojis unless I add them
> Angles:
> 1) ...
> 2) ...
> 3) ...

## 5) Publish in 30 Minutes (A Tiny Schedule)

Here’s a simple "tonight" plan:
- 10 min: generate 20 angles
- 10 min: pick 7 + draft
- 10 min: make 1 template visual + reuse it

If you have more time, batch 14 posts (two weeks) and schedule them.

## FAQ

### Will this make my posts sound generic?
Not if you force specificity: one offer, one audience, one proof point per post. Generic prompts create generic posts.

### What if I don’t have proof yet?
Use a small proof: a quick screenshot, a number from your analytics, or a micro-example ("here’s the before/after hook").

### What should I promote?
Start with the page that matters most this month: your best converting offer, your flagship article, or your lead magnet.
