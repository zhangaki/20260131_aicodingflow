## Execution Utility: Publish-Ready Checklist (Pass/Fail)

Use this checklist to turn “tool choice” into a repeatable workflow. Each item has a clear **Pass/Fail** so you can ship content with confidence.

### A. Pick the right tool for the job (2 minutes)

1. **Primary output is clear** (blog post, landing page, ads, or social captions).
   - **Pass:** you can name the output type + word count range.
   - **Fail:** “I just need content” (too vague).
2. **You have 3 reference inputs** (links, bullet notes, or your own outline).
   - **Pass:** at least 3 concrete inputs are ready.
   - **Fail:** you’re asking the AI to invent everything from scratch.
3. **You can evaluate the result** (tone, audience, CTA).
   - **Pass:** you wrote 1 sentence for audience + 1 sentence for desired action.
   - **Fail:** no target reader or no next step.

### B. Generate content in one controlled loop (10–20 minutes)

4. **Prompt includes constraints** (audience, tone, structure, and do/don’t).
   - **Pass:** prompt contains at least 3 constraints.
   - **Fail:** only a topic, no constraints.
5. **Output has a scannable structure** (H2 sections, bullets, short paragraphs).
   - **Pass:** at least 4 H2s or clearly separated sections.
   - **Fail:** single wall-of-text.
6. **Claims are verifiable** (no invented stats/citations).
   - **Pass:** every statistic or quote has a source link you can check.
   - **Fail:** any “looks right” numbers without sources.

### C. SEO + on-page quality gate (3–5 minutes)

7. **Title is unique and matches the query.**
   - **Pass:** includes the primary query and isn’t a copy of another page title.
   - **Fail:** generic title like “Best Tools” without context.
8. **Meta description is benefit-driven.**
   - **Pass:** 1–2 sentences: who it’s for + outcome.
   - **Fail:** stuffed keywords or no clear benefit.
9. **Internal links exist and make sense.**
   - **Pass:** at least 2 relevant internal links with descriptive anchors.
   - **Fail:** zero internal links, or anchors like “click here”.
10. **Run a quick on-page audit.**
   - **Pass:** the page passes your own checks, and you’ve fixed issues flagged by our tool.
   - **Fail:** you didn’t run a check, or you ignored obvious errors.

### D. Final human edit (10 minutes)

11. **First 100 words explain outcome + who it’s for.**
   - **Pass:** reader understands value immediately.
   - **Fail:** long generic intro.
12. **One “original insight” is included** (opinion, framework, or example).
   - **Pass:** at least one section clearly reflects your real experience.
   - **Fail:** pure AI rewrite with no added value.
13. **CTA is specific.**
