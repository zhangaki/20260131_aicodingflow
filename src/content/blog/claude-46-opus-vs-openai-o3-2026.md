## Hands-On Analysis: Claude 4.6 Opus

**The highest-reasoning model available for complex, multi-step agentic tasks.**

### What We Liked
- Massive 1M output context (new for 4.6)
- Agentic reasoning capabilities
- Zero-retention data privacy by default
- Computer Use V2 (90% success rate)

### The Hard Truth (Limitations)
- Significantly slower than Sonnet
- Expensive per token
- No native image generation

### Operational Cost
$30/month (Opus Tier)

> [!TIP]
> Agent Tip: The 'Computer Use V2' is reliable for browser tasks but still struggles with complex terminal navigations—always monitor it.

## Hands-On Analysis: OpenAI o3

**The first 'reasoning engine' designed purely for scientific and mathematical breakthroughs.**

### What We Liked
- Chain-of-thought verification (visible)
- Self-correcting code generation
- PhD-level math capabilities
- Deep research autonomous mode

### The Hard Truth (Limitations)
- Extremely high latency (up to 30s)
- Cost prohibitive for general use
- Strict safety guardrails

### Operational Cost
$200/month (Researcher Tier)

> [!TIP]
> Prompt Strategy: Unlike GPT-4, do NOT prompt with 'act as a...'. Just state the problem raw; o3 performs better without persona fluff.
