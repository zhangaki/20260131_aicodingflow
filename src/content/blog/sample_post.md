# Stop Burning Hours on “Small” Dev Tasks: Automate the Repeat Work with AI

Boilerplate edits, renames, flaky test fixes, lint churn, and careful refactors look small—until they quietly eat 5–10 hours every week.

This guide shows a practical workflow to hand those repeat loops to AI tools while keeping your codebase clean, so you ship the feature work faster.

Next step (5 minutes): write down the last 10 “repeat” tasks you did this week. As you read, pick one loop (e.g., rename across files + fix imports + update tests) and automate it today using the categories below.
