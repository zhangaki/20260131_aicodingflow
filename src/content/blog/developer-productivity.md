# Developer Productivity (Practical Checklist)

If you end most days with “worked a lot, shipped little”, this checklist is for you.

**Outcome:** In 30 minutes, you’ll produce one concrete artifact (a merged PR, a closed bug, a drafted doc section) using a strict **Pass/Fail** workflow.

**Next step:** Jump to **Execution Utility: 30-Minute Productivity Sprint** and run it once—don’t customize anything until you get your first Pass.

If you publish developer content, pair this guide with our tools:

- Run a quick on-page check: [SEO Audit](/tools/seo-audit)
- Find low-competition topics: [Keyword Research Tool](/tools/keyword-research)

## Execution Utility: 30-Minute Productivity Sprint (Pass/Fail)

Use this section when you want a *measurable* productivity gain today. Set a timer, do the steps in order, and mark **Pass** only when the criteria is met.

### 0) Setup (2 minutes)

- **Action:** Start a 30-minute timer and open a scratchpad.
- **Pass:** Timer is running and you have a place to write (issue, doc, notes).
- **Fail:** You’re “getting ready” without a timer.

### 1) Pick one measurable outcome (3 minutes)

- **Action:** Write one sentence: “In the next 30 minutes, I will ship ____.”
- **Pass:** The outcome is observable (e.g. “merge PR #123”, “close bug ABC-42”, “publish blog post draft”).
- **Fail:** Outcome is vague (e.g. “work on refactor”, “improve code quality”).

### 2) Reduce scope to the smallest shippable change (5 minutes)

- **Action:** Create a 3-item micro-task list.
- **Pass:** Each item is ≤ 10 minutes and ends with a concrete artifact (commit, PR comment, updated doc section).
- **Fail:** Any item requires “research”, “figure out architecture”, or exceeds 10 minutes.

### 3) Use AI for a single narrow task (not the whole job) (5 minutes)

- **Action:** Ask AI for exactly one deliverable you can paste into your work.
- **Good requests (pick one):**
  - “Write a failing unit test for this bug description: …”
  - “Suggest a minimal diff for this function to handle X edge case.”
  - “Draft a 7-line doc section explaining how to run this command.”
- **Pass:** The AI output is directly usable (test, diff, doc snippet) and you can apply it within 5 minutes.
- **Fail:** You’re prompting for strategy/architecture, or you got a generic wall of text.

### 4) Ship the artifact (10 minutes)

- **Action:** Apply the smallest change that completes your outcome.
- **Pass:** One of the following exists by the end of the step:
  - A commit pushed, or a PR created/updated
  - A bug ticket updated with repro steps + fix summary
  - A doc section merged or submitted for review
- **Fail:** You have notes but nothing that another person can review.

### 5) Proof + record (5 minutes)

- **Action:** Create a 3-line sprint log:
  1) What shipped (link/ID)
  2) What was hardest (1 sentence)
  3) Next smallest step (1 sentence)
- **Pass:** Log exists in the issue/PR/doc and can be referenced tomorrow.
- **Fail:** The result only exists in your head.

## Practical Checklist (Pass/Fail)

Use this checklist when you want a simple daily “am I actually shipping?” score. Each item is designed to be objective and testable.

### A) Today produced a reviewable artifact

- **Action:** Point to one URL/ID created or updated today.
- **Pass:** At least one exists (PR link, commit hash, issue comment URL, doc section PR).
- **Fail:** Nothing exists that another person can open.

### B) Work-in-progress is capped

- **Action:** Count active tasks you’re “in the middle of” (not done, not parked).
- **Pass:** ≤ 2 active tasks.
- **Fail:** ≥ 3 active tasks (you’re context switching by default).

### C) You removed one bottleneck

- **Action:** Identify the single biggest blocker from today and remove or reduce it.
- **Pass:** You did one of the following:
  - Added repro steps + expected/actual
  - Wrote a failing test
  - Reduced a task into 3 micro-tasks
  - Asked a teammate a single specific question
- **Fail:** Blocker remains vague (“something about config”).

### D) You can restart tomorrow in 60 seconds

- **Action:** Write a one-sentence “next step”.
- **Pass:** A future you could continue without re-reading context.
- **Fail:** You’d need to “re-figure out what I was doing.”
