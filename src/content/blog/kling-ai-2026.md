## Security & Access Brief: The Kling Ai Protocol

We have analyzed the breakout behavior of **kling ai**. Unlike standard search updates, this shift impacts the **Machine Access** layer of your infrastructure. 

### Why kling ai Triggers an Audit

If your robots.txt or agents.txt files aren't calibrated for the logic used by kling ai, your high-value content becomes "dark data"—invisible to the very engines that generate modern search traffic.

### Technical Analysis
Generative video is moving from toys to tools. kling ai represents the next wave of 'Resolution-as-a-Service' where frame-level semantic data becomes a ranking signal.

### Tactical Response
- **Machine Access Validation**: Ensure no legacy firewall rules are blocking the user-agents associated with kling ai. Run a [Full Visibility Audit](/tools/aeo-audit).
- **Entity Identification**: Use Schema.json to define your relationship with the concepts kling ai interprets.
