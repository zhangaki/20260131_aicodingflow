For teams that rely heavily on this capability, it alone can justify the subscription cost.

### 4. Computer Use V2 (90% success rate)

A practical feature that saves significant time in daily workflows. We found that computer use v2 (90% success rate) integrates smoothly into typical workflows and delivers tangible productivity improvements. For teams that rely heavily on this capability, it alone can justify the subscription cost.

## Our Testing Experience

We used Claude 4.6 Opus for over three weeks across multiple real-world projects. Here are the highlights of our experience:

We started our Claude 4.6 Opus evaluation with deliberately high expectations, given the positive industry buzz. The onboarding was smoother than expected -- within an hour, our team was productive with the core features.

The middle weeks of testing revealed the true depth of the platform. Features that seemed simple on the surface had surprising power when combined with advanced configurations. We found ourselves discovering new capabilities even in week three.

The most telling metric: by the end of our test, nobody on the team wanted to switch back to our previous tooling. That kind of organic adoption is hard to fake and speaks to the genuine quality of the daily user experience.

> **Pro Tip:** Opus 4.6 is slow. Use it to architect the solution, then switch to Sonnet for the actual code generation to save 40% time.

---

## The Verdict

Claude 4.6 Opus earns a solid recommendation for Enterprise architects and developers building autonomous agent swarms.. Its core strength -- The highest-reasoning model available for complex, multi-step agentic tasks. -- is genuinely differentiated in the 2026 market.

However, it is not without trade-offs. The limitations around Significantly slower than Sonnet mean it is not the right choice for every user. If those limitations are deal-breakers for you, consider OpenAI o3 as your primary option.

**Bottom line:** If you fall into Claude 4.6 Opus's target audience, it is one of the best options available in 2026. Start with the trial period (if available) to evaluate it against your specific workflow before upgrading.
