This guide reveals how AI can banish writer's block, slash writing time, and optimize your content for SEO. Find tools to generate ideas, improve grammar, and create engaging posts that attract readers. See our top recommendations.

## Execution Utility: 45-minute evaluation checklist (pass/fail)

Use this checklist to test any AI writing assistant in a real workflow (not just a demo). Each step has a **clear pass/fail** so you can compare tools quickly.

Before you start:
- Pick one real draft you must publish this week (600–1,200 words).
- Define your target query + intent in one sentence.
- Open these internal utilities (you’ll use them during the test):
  - [SEO Audit Tool](/tools/seo-audit)
  - [Website Performance Tools](/tools/website-performance)

### Step 1 — Outline + draft speed (10 minutes)

**Action**: Ask the tool to generate:
1) a blog outline (H2/H3), then
2) an intro + 2 body sections.

**Pass** if all are true:
- Outline includes at least **5 H2s** and matches the intent.
- Draft is **≥ 600 words** within 10 minutes.
- No obviously fabricated facts/claims (e.g., fake statistics, fake product features).

**Fail** if any are true:
- Generic outline that could fit any topic.
- Draft needs heavy rewriting to be usable.

### Step 2 — Readability & brand voice (10 minutes)

**Action**: Rewrite one paragraph in two styles:
- “Friendly + concise”
- “Expert + precise”

**Pass** if all are true:
- The meaning stays consistent (no new claims added).
- You can control tone via a short instruction (≤ 2 sentences).
- Final paragraph is easier to scan (shorter sentences, more concrete verbs).

**Fail** if:
- It repeatedly ignores tone instructions.
- It changes meaning or adds questionable claims.

### Step 3 — SEO on-page basics (10 minutes)

**Action**: Have the tool propose:
- 1 title tag (≤ 60 chars)
- 1 meta description (≤ 155 chars)
- 5–10 related terms to cover
- Suggested H2s aligned to those terms

Then validate quickly using: [SEO Audit Tool](/tools/seo-audit).

**Pass** if all are true:
- Title includes the primary query naturally (not keyword-stuffed).
- Meta description is specific (benefit + audience) and not generic.
- Related terms are relevant (no random synonyms that don’t fit intent).

**Fail** if:
- Suggestions are copy-pasted boilerplate.
- It can’t generate a coherent H2 structure from the terms.

### Step 4 — Originality & citations (10 minutes)

**Action**: Ask it to add 3 concrete examples or mini-case studies.

**Pass** if:
- Examples are plausible and clearly framed as examples (not presented as “facts”).
- When asked “what sources support this?”, it can either cite sources you provide or it clearly says it has none.

**Fail** if:
- It confidently invents sources, quotes, or data.

### Step 5 — Publishability (5 minutes)

**Action**: Do a final “publish pass”:
- Add internal links (at least 2) to relevant pages.
- Generate a featured image prompt (1–2 sentences) you can reuse.

**Pass** if:
- You can ship with < 20 minutes of manual editing remaining.
- It suggests sensible internal links (examples: `/tools/seo-audit`, `/tools/website-performance`).

**Fail** if:
- You’re basically rewriting from scratch.

### Scoring (optional, but fast)

Give each step 0/1.
- **4–5**: strong daily driver
- **2–3**: useful for ideation only
- **0–1**: skip
