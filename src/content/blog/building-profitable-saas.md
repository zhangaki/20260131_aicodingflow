## Profitable SaaS Building Checklist

> Most first-time SaaS fails because you ship before you can answer three questions: **who is it for, what pain is urgent, and how will you get your first 10 customers?**
>
> **Outcome:** in ~20 minutes, you’ll have (1) a one‑sentence ICP, (2) one concrete “they already pay/time-spend” signal, and (3) a simple MVP + first acquisition plan for this week.
>
> **Next step:** open the first row (**Define target audience**) and write: “I help [who] do [job] without [pain].” If you can’t fill it in, don’t build yet.

| Task | Criteria | Pass | Fail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Define target audience | Clearly defined ideal customer profile with specific demographics and pain points. |  |  |
| Validate problem demand (PMF signal) | 10+ conversations (or surveys) with target users + evidence they already spend time/money solving this problem. |  |  |
| Choose one acquisition channel | Pick one primary channel (SEO, outbound, marketplaces, partnerships, paid) and define the first 10 actions to get in front of customers. |  |  |
| Build a minimum viable product (MVP) | Shippable MVP that solves one core job end-to-end and can be demoed in < 2 minutes. |  |  |
| Instrument + onboarding basics | Tracking for activation + retention + revenue; onboarding that gets users to “first value” fast. |  |  |
| Implement basic SEO (if SEO is your channel) | Target 1–3 long-tail keywords, publish 1 pillar page + 3 supporting posts, and ensure pages are indexable. |  |  |
| Launch + collect feedback | Launch to a small audience, capture objections, and iterate weekly based on usage + support questions. |  |  |
