# Stop Wasting Time: The Only AI Tool Guide You'll Ever Need

You try a new AI tool, spend an hour setting it up… and it still doesn’t fit your workflow.

This guide gets you from “too many options” → “pick one and ship”:

- Choose the job first (writing, SEO, marketing, etc.).
- Pick tools that integrate with your stack (Docs, GitHub, Slack, CMS) before you optimize features.
- Jump to the next step: keyword research, an SEO audit, or speed checks.

## A simple way to choose the right AI tool (in 10 minutes)

Most tool roundups fail because they start with brand names. Start with constraints instead:

1. **Input:** what will you feed it (briefs, URLs, docs, code, analytics)?
2. **Output:** what do you need shipped (draft, outline, meta title, internal links, report)?
3. **Workflow fit:** where will it live (browser, IDE, Google Docs, CMS) and who needs access?
4. **Quality bar:** does it support citations/sources, versioning, and easy human editing?
5. **Cost control:** can you cap usage, set roles, and avoid surprise bills?

If a tool can’t answer those five points clearly, skip it.

Start here:
If you’re creating content, begin with keyword demand → [Keyword Research Tool](/tools/keyword-research).
If you already have pages live, run an [SEO Audit Tool](/tools/seo-audit), then check load time with our [Website Performance Checker](/tools/website-performance).
