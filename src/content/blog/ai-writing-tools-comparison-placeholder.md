# AI Writing Tool Comparison

If a blog post takes you 3–6 hours, the time sink is rarely “writing” — it’s staring at a blank doc, rewriting the same paragraph, and polishing until you run out of patience. The right AI writing tool helps you get to a clean first draft fast (and keep your voice), so you can spend your time on facts, examples, and distribution.

This comparison shows what each tool is actually good at (first drafts, rewrites, SEO briefs, editing), the tradeoffs, and who should skip it. Next step: pick two tools from the table and run the same test on both (one outline → draft, one messy paragraph → rewrite) to see which fits your workflow.

After you pick a tool, use our [keyword research tool](/tools/keyword-research) to choose a low‑competition keyword for your next post.

If you want to improve your site’s SEO baseline first, try our [SEO audit tool](/tools/seo-audit) to spot the biggest technical issues holding pages back.

## Execution Utility: 30-Minute Tool Bake-Off (Checklist)

Use this checklist to evaluate any AI writing tool in a way that’s **actionable, repeatable, and pass/fail**. Run it on **two tools** so you can compare outcomes under the same constraints.

### Setup (2 minutes)

- **Pick one keyword** you can plausibly rank for.
  - **Pass:** keyword is specific (≥ 4 words) and not a broad head term.
  - **Fail:** keyword is generic (“AI writing tools”, “best AI writer”).
- **Open two internal pages** to keep the test grounded:
  - [Keyword Research Tool](/tools/keyword-research) (choose the keyword)
  - [SEO Audit Tool](/tools/seo-audit) (pre‑publish checks)

### Test A — Outline → Draft (12 minutes)

1. **Prompt for an outline** (paste the exact same prompt into both tools).
   - **Pass:** outline has 6–10 H2s, includes “who it’s for”, “steps”, and “FAQ”.
   - **Fail:** outline is 3–4 headings, vague (“Introduction / Body / Conclusion”).
2. **Generate a first draft** from the outline (1,000–1,500 words).
   - **Pass:** draft has examples or specifics in ≥ 3 sections (not just generic claims).
   - **Fail:** reads like a paraphrased Wikipedia page or repeats itself.
3. **Voice control check:** ask it to rewrite the intro in your voice (give 2–3 style constraints).
   - **Pass:** constraints are followed without losing clarity.
   - **Fail:** becomes fluffy, salesy, or ignores constraints.

### Test B — Messy Paragraph → Rewrite (8 minutes)

4. Paste a messy paragraph from an old post (or write one quickly), then ask for:
   - a clearer rewrite,
   - a shorter version (≤ 60 words),
   - and 3 alternative hooks.
   - **Pass:** rewrites preserve meaning and improve readability; hooks are distinct.
   - **Fail:** changes facts/meaning, adds new claims, or all hooks feel the same.

### Test C — SEO Packaging (8 minutes)

5. Ask for **3 title options** + **1 meta description** for your chosen keyword.
   - **Pass:** title includes the keyword naturally; meta says who it’s for + outcome.
   - **Fail:** keyword stuffing, clickbait, or meta is generic.
6. **Internal link suggestions:** ask for 3 internal links with anchor text.
   - **Pass:** anchors are descriptive and not “click here”.
   - **Fail:** anchors are generic or irrelevant to the page.

### Score + Decision (Final)

- **Pass (Use this tool):** it passes **≥ 5 of 6** checks above, and you would publish the draft after light editing.
- **Fail (Skip for now):** it fails **≥ 2** checks, or it repeatedly invents details you didn’t provide.

If you want the fastest workflow, run **Keyword Research → Draft → SEO Audit** in that order:
- Start at [Keyword Research Tool](/tools/keyword-research)
- Draft with your chosen AI tool
- Pre‑publish with [SEO Audit Tool](/tools/seo-audit)
