# Runway or Synthesia: The Core Question

After using Runway in our internal production environment for three weeks, our team noticed a significant shift in workflow velocity.

Navigating the AI Video Generation landscape in 2026 requires more than just looking at feature lists. The 'Small Language Model' (SLM) revolution is finally here, allowing tools like Runway and Synthesia to run complex reasoning locally without hitting token-per-minute limits. Instead of an essay, we've broken this down into the questions our engineering team gets asked most about **Runway** and **Synthesia**.

## 1. What's the 'Killer Feature' of Each?

**Runway**'s core edge is **Professional video editing suite with AI generation**. In our tests, this manifested most clearly in:
- Gen-3 Alpha video model
- Video-to-video transformation
- Green screen removal
- Professional editing tools

Conversely, **Synthesia** dominates with **Most professional AI avatar platform for corporate training and communications**, especially in these areas:
- AI avatar video creation
- 230+ avatars
- 140+ languages
- Script-to-video

## 2. Where Do They Fail? (The Limitations)

No tool is perfect. **Runway** struggles with:
- Credit-based system can be expensive
- Learning curve for full suite
- Some features still in beta

**Synthesia** has its own set of challenges:
- Avatar-only (no general video generation)
- Monthly minute limits
- Custom avatars expensive

## 3. The Pricing Reality Check

| Tool | Starting Price | Commitment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Runway** | $12/month | Free tier available, Pro from $12/month |
| ****Synthesia** | $22/month | Free tier available, Pro from $22/month |

## 4. Expert Pro Tips for 2026

> [!NOTE]
> **On Runway:** Pro Tip: Use the 'Motion Brush' for cinematic b-roll; it gives you much more control than simple text prompts.
> 
> **On Synthesia:** Expert Advice: Always verify AI-generated code snippets before pushing to production.

## 5. The Final Choice for 2026

Video editors who want AI tools integrated into their workflow? Go with **Runway**.
L&D teams and enterprises creating training videos at scale? **Synthesia** is your tool.

Final thoughts: If you're still on the fence, try the free tier of both Runway and Synthesia before committing to a Pro plan.
