During our 'Head-to-Head' engineering audit last month, we found that GitHub Copilot handles large-scale refactors with surprising stability. 

Selecting the right platform between GitHub Copilot and Tabnine often comes down to specific edge-case performance. Data privacy has become the primary bottleneck for corporate AI adoption, leading to a massive surge in demand for tools that offer local inference or strict zero-retention policies. This guide compares **GitHub Copilot** and **Tabnine** based on performance benchmarks, true cost of ownership, and real-world stability.
