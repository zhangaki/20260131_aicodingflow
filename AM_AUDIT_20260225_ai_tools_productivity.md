Audit of '10+ AI Tools to Automate Your Workday & Boost Productivity'

*   **Utility:** The article provides a list of AI tools for productivity with specific categories and actionable checklists. This format is generally useful for readers looking for practical applications of AI.
*   **Specificity:** The article includes checklists with pass/fail criteria, making the tool evaluations more specific and measurable. However, the descriptions of the tools themselves could be more detailed.
*   **Factuality:** The tool descriptions and automation capabilities need to be verified with web searches to ensure the information is current and correct.

**Rewrite Actions:**

1.  **Verify tool information:** Fact-check the descriptions of Grammarly, ProWritingAid, Front, Missive, Todoist, Asana, Calendly, x.ai, Scholarcy, ResearchGate, GitHub Copilot, and Tabnine to ensure they are accurate and up-to-date.
2.  **Add more details to tool descriptions:** Provide more information about each tool's features, pricing, and integrations.
3.  **Improve the quality of the checklists:** Ensure that the pass/fail criteria are realistic and relevant. Some of the criteria may need to be adjusted to be more meaningful.
4.  **Reduce redundant internal links:** As with the previous article, there are many redundant internal links. Choose the most relevant link and remove the rest.
5.  **Add a section on AI meeting summarization tools:** The description mentions "new AI meeting summarization tools," but this topic is not covered in the article. Add a section on tools like Otter.ai or Fireflies.ai.
6.  **Consider adding screenshots or videos:** Visual aids could help readers understand how to use the tools more effectively.
