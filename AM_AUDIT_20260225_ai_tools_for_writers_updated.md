**Content Audit:**

*   **Utility:** The article aims to provide content creators with a list of useful AI writing tools. It mentions Grammarly, ProWritingAid, and Jasper. However, the descriptions are very basic and lack depth. The section on brainstorming and outlining is also generic.
*   **Specificity:** The article lacks specific examples of how to use each tool. It doesn't provide any prompts or outputs. It also doesn't compare the tools or provide any pricing information.
*   **Factuality:** The information presented is generally accurate, but it lacks specific examples and links to back up the claims. The repeated links to other guides in the introduction and throughout the article are distracting and unnecessary.

**Rewrite Actions:**

1.  **Provide Detailed Tool Descriptions:** Expand the descriptions of Grammarly, ProWritingAid, and Jasper. Include specific features, use cases, and pricing information.
2.  **Add Concrete Examples:** Include examples of how to use each tool for different writing tasks.
3.  **Compare the Tools:** Provide a comparison table that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each tool.
4.  **Remove Redundant Links:** Remove the repeated links to other guides in the introduction and throughout the article. Consolidate these into a single "Resources" section at the end.
5.  **Expand on Brainstorming and Outlining:** Provide more specific examples of how to use AI for brainstorming and outlining. Include prompts and outputs.
6.  **Fact-check and update:** Verify that the tools mentioned are still active and that the pricing is current.
