# CTR Improvement Record: /blog/ai-tools-guide

**Date:** 2026-02-25

## 1) Target + Baseline

- **Target URL:** `/blog/ai-tools-guide`
- **Baseline CTR:** Unknown (not found in repo records)
- **Why This Page:** This is the primary blog file (`src/content/blog/ai-tools-guide.md`) and is likely a high-impression entry page. However, current workspace does not contain Search Console export or a CTR baseline for this specific URL.

## 2) Concrete Changes Applied (Intent Fit)

### Title
- **Old:** Best AI Tools for Solopreneurs: Automate Your Business & Save Time
- **New:** AI Tools for Solopreneurs: 25+ Apps to Automate Marketing, Content & Admin (2026)
- **Rationale:**
  - Adds a clear quantity promise ("25+") which tends to lift CTR for comparison/list queries.
  - Expands the intent coverage beyond generic "productivity" into the main jobs-to-be-done (marketing, content, admin) that solopreneurs search for.
  - Adds recency (2026) to reduce "stale list" hesitation.

### Description
- **Old:** Discover the best AI tools for solopreneurs to automate content creation, marketing, and admin tasks. Save time, increase efficiency, and grow your business with these AI-powered solutions.
- **New:** Compare 25+ AI tools solopreneurs use to write content, design assets, run marketing, handle email/support, and automate admin. See best picks by task + a quick evaluation checklist.
- **Rationale:**
  - Matches SERP intent: "compare" + "by task" + "checklist" indicates scannable, decision-support content.
  - Adds concrete categories (design, email/support) to catch more long-tail queries.

### First ~120 words
- **Old (summary):** Generic solopreneur overwhelm + broad benefits + CTA.
- **New (current intro):**
  "Trying to run marketing, content, customer support, and admin by yourself? This guide lists 25+ practical AI tools solopreneurs can use to save hours each week—organized by task (writing, design, video, SEO, email/support, and automation). You’ll get quick recommendations, what each tool is best for, and a simple checklist to decide if it’s worth paying for. Want to see whether your site shows up in ChatGPT/Perplexity results too?

- **Rationale:**
  - Leads with the exact pain + scope, then immediately explains structure ("organized by task") to reduce bounce.
  - Introduces what the reader will get (recommendations + "best for" + checklist) within the first screen.

## 3) Expected Impact + Follow-up Window

- **Expected Impact:** Higher CTR from more specific promise (25+ tools), task-based framing, and fresher year marker.
- **Follow-up Check Window:** 14–28 days (2026-03-11 to 2026-03-25)

## Blocker / Missing Data
