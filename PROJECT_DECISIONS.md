# Project Strategy & Decision Log: SEO Site Engine

## Core Goal: Earn USD (美金变现)
- **Primary Market**: Global / English-speaking regions (US, UK, Canada, Australia, etc.).
- **Monetization**: Google AdSense (USD) & Global SaaS Affiliates (USD).
- **Decision Date**: 2026-01-31

### Key Strategic Decisions
1. **English-First Content**: All automated articles must be high-quality English. No Chinese content allowed for this specific site.
2. **High CPM Niches**: Focus on AI tools, SaaS, and Productivity where AdSense CPM is higher in the US market.
3. **Auditor Requirement**: The AI Auditor (Worker 01) must ensure the English is natural (Native-level flow) and void of "Chinglish" or AI-isms.

### Prudence Principle (稳重原则)
- **Neutral Reporting**: Workers must report facts (e.g., "3 articles indexed") rather than predictions (e.g., "1000 USD coming soon").
- **Evidence-First**: No major production spikes until the first 10 articles show indexing signals in Search Console.
- **Risk Mitigation**: All tasks must include a "What if it fails?" contingency step.

### Performance Checkpoints (Pivot or Persevere)
- **Week 2 Checkpoint (2026-02-14)**:
    - **Metric**: Total Impressions in GSC > 500.
    - **Goal**: At least 5 articles indexed by Google.
    - **Action**: If impressions < 100, analyze keyword difficulty and pivot to even more niche/long-tail topics.
- **Month 1 Checkpoint (2026-03-01)**:
    - **Metric**: First click-throughs and AdSense application readiness.
