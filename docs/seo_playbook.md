## 💰 Monetization Roadmap
*Current Status: Traffic Accumulation Phase (Pre-Monetization)*

1. **Checkpoint 1 (100 Clicks/Day)**: Enable Google AdSense.
2. **Checkpoint 2 (Deep Interest)**: Integrate affiliate links for AI tools mentioned in "AEO Audit" section.
3. **Checkpoint 3 (Agency/SaaS)**: Pivot "AEO Auditor" into a lead gen tool for SEO consulting.

> [!TIP]
> **Actionable Discovery**: Google is rewarding "Engineer-to-Engineer" semantic patterns (e.g., "cpu blog engineer"). Avoid generic "AI News" keywords and stick to technical architecture terminology.
