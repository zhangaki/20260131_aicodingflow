## 📈 Strategic Framework (The Playbook)

### Phase 1: The 0-1 Sprint (Cold Start)
- **Tech Stack**: Astro (Static) + Vercel + JSON-LD Schema.
- **Content Strategy**: Minimum 50+ posts for "Niche Density."
- **Efficiency Trigger**: Use `BaseHead.astro` for global meta parity.

### Phase 2: Domain Authority & Indexing Velocity (Active)
- **Rising Trends Strategy**: Use Google Trends "Rising queries" to bypass "Sandbox" effects.
- **Topical Mesh**: Activate "Related Insights" component across 117+ posts for dense internal linking.
- **Metric to Watch**: "Indexing Ratio" (Total Posts vs. GSC Indexed Pages).

### 🛡️ Content Hardening Golden Rules (Anti-Spam)
1. **Technical First**: Avoid generic "What is" content. Focus on **Deployment Protocols (Tactical Responses)** to signal technical utility.
2. **Code/Table Integrity**: Every deep-dive post must have a validated table (Metric | Target | Standard) to show data density.
3. **AEO/GEO markers**: Include explicit mentions of `llms.txt`, `JSON-LD`, and `crawlers` to attract AI-native traffic.
4. **Diversity Verification**: Run `audit_markdown.py` and `deep_scan.py` before any bulk deployment to catch fontmatter or syntax errors.

## 💰 Monetization Roadmap
*Current Status: Traffic Accumulation Phase (Pre-Monetization)*

1. **Checkpoint 1 (100 Clicks/Day)**: Enable Google AdSense.
2. **Checkpoint 2 (Deep Interest)**: Integrate affiliate links for AI tools mentioned in "AEO Audit" section.
3. **Checkpoint 3 (Agency/SaaS)**: Pivot "AEO Auditor" into a lead gen tool for SEO consulting.

> [!TIP]
> **Actionable Discovery**: Google is rewarding "Engineer-to-Engineer" semantic patterns (e.g., "cpu blog engineer"). Avoid generic "AI News" keywords and stick to technical architecture terminology.
