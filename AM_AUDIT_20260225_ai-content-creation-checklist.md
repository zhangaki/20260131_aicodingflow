Audit of 'AI Content Creation Checklist' article:

Evaluation:
* Utility: This checklist is highly useful. It provides a very structured approach to content creation using AI tools, with clear pass/fail criteria and specific actions. The detailed instructions and examples make it easy to follow.
* Specificity: The checklist is extremely specific, providing concrete examples of tools, techniques, and criteria. The inclusion of specific KD and search volume numbers for keyword research is a great example of this.
* Factuality: As with the previous article, I need to verify that the tools and techniques mentioned are accurate and up-to-date. I also need to ensure that the pass/fail criteria are reasonable and achievable. For example, the recommendation of KD < 20 and search volume > 100/month is a good starting point, but it may not be applicable to all niches.

Rewrite Actions:
1. Verify Tool Information: Use `search_web` to verify the tools mentioned in the checklist, such as Ahrefs, Semrush, Google Keyword Planner, Copyscape, and Grammarly. Ensure that the descriptions and instructions are accurate.
2. Review Pass/Fail Criteria: Evaluate the pass/fail criteria to ensure that they are reasonable and achievable for the target audience. Consider adjusting the criteria based on the specific niche or content goals.
3. Reduce Internal Links (Slightly): While the internal links are helpful, consider adding a bit more context directly within the checklist to reduce reliance on them.
4. Address the Use of AI Cliches: Ensure that the content avoids common AI cliches and sounds natural and human-written.
